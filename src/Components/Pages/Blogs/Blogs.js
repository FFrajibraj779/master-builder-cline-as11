          Tokens are most commonly used to identify an authenticated user. They
          are issued by an authentication server and are consumed by the
          client-server (to secure its APIs).{" "}

          Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt signed
          using either a secret salt or a private key. User's Client uses the
          JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in HTTP
          Authorization header. Resource server then verifies the authenticity
          of the token using the secret salt/ public key.

          How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
          EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
          architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
          that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener
          for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request without I/O
          blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and
          sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible
          to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster
          module or worker_threads module.
